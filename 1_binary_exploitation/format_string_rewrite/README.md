# Return address overwrite using format string

This is very tricky in real life. Over here this is only meant to be done in
GDB since you can't leak stack addresses that easily. And even then there's a
lot of things that need to be taken care of.

Inside GDB, just see the address the return address is present at, put it in
the buffer, and then reference the buffer in the format string. Put the address
at the very end since `printf` will stop printing if it encounters a null byte.
