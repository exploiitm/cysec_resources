- [pwn.college](pwn.college): This resource is maintained by Arizona State
University and has an extensive collection of challenges, videos, lecture
material and even an LLM bot trained specifically on it to help you solve the
challenges and answer queries.

- [TryHackMe PWN101](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/pwn101): The room covers all
basic types of binary exploits but has a somewhat steep curve.

# How to go about the directories

`./basics` contains the basic programs to understand function execution and
how buffer overflows work in principle.

`./canary` contains an example to run canary code and a script to exploit it.

`./compilation` contains information about shared objects, GOT, and PLT.

`./ret2libc` contains an example of a ret2libc attack on 64 bit with a brief
intro to ROP gadgets.

`./ret_addr` shows how you can manipulate the return address to hit the target
of your choice, shellcode or function.

`./shellcodes` shows you how you can invoke a shellcode from the stack as a
function.

## Some helpful tips

`gcc -no-pie file.c -o file.out`: sets the code to NOT be position independent
executable. Use this if you want to disable PIE.

`gcc -fno-stack-protector file.c -o file.out`: removes canaries.

`gcc -z execstack file.c -o file.out`: Makes stack executable (shellcodes go
brr).

`gcc -static file.c -o file.out`: Statically link all files (no dynamic
loading).

If you want to disable ASLR, edit the file `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
and set the value to 0. The default is 2, accepted values are 0, 1 and 2.

If you want to attach GDB to a running process, set
`/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope` to 0. Set it back to 1 to enable it. Then
execute the binary and gdb using `./bin & gdb -p $(pidof bin)` where `bin` is
the binary name.
